                            <b>Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks,</b> they are 
                            unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway 
                            what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its 
                            being a question. The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found 
                            it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and 
                            now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at 
                            any rate anybody can and does see it that way.

                            So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly
                            obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, 
                            and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way 
                            about them.

                    There are some punctuations <br>
                    that are interesting and there <br>
                    are some punctuations that <br>
                    are not. Let us begin with the <br>
                    punctuations that are not.
