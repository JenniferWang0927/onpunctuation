                                There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations 
                                that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not.

                            Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting 
                            is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone 
                            when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration 
                            but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. 
                            It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can 
                            read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph-two">
                            Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark. Beside 
                            it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the 
                            eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. 
                            A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add 
                            to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in 
                            the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found 
                            it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.
