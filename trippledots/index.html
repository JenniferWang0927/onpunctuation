                            One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession. <b>
                                
                        <p class="paragraph-one">
                            Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no
                            regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in.

                    There are some punctuations <br>

                    are some punctuations that <br>
                    are not. Let us begin with the <br>
                    punctuations that are not.
